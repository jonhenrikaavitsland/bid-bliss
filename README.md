## Reflections on my planning:

I found quite early that my planning was off and that this project was going to require more from me than I had originally expected.
Close to 900 commits and 30+ PR's later I look back at my journey for the past 5 weeks recognizing that I have learned so much from all the research i was forced to do and I now feel like i have improved my skills quite a bit.
I was planning to take some time off to not have a repeat off my experience with fatigue from last exam, but there was no room for it.
Luckily I didn't experience the level of fatigue I did back then.
Overall I am pretty satisfied with my delivery.

## Testing:

### I had planned to conduct unit-testing and e2e-testing for this project, but time was not on my side.

#### Since testing was not required, but i had planned to perform it, I have left the project configured and ready for future tester to write testing code.

##### The only tests which are performed for the badges in this readme file are a few baseline tests.
